Mark your code with special tag //@author matric-number. We use these tags to extract code written by each person (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use this collate tool [link coming soon] to extract individual code (Windows only. Unzip and follow instructions in the readme.txt) and look through the generated .col files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly. Push the *.col files created to a folder called /collated in your repo.

Extract your code for code quality grading

Ensure that the tag is used precisely as given above (i.e. Not // @author matric-number Not /* @author matric-number */ etc.). This tag is different from the normal Javadoc @author tag. Please remove the normal @author javadoc tag if you have it in the code.
Here is a sample code file:
//@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@author A0909865X
method 4 ...
The //@author tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code upto the next //@author tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author.
If a method was written by more than one person, the //@author tag should indicate the person who wrote most of that method. i.e., //@author tag should not appear inside a method.
If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product, you may use //@author matric-number-unused mark them. 
e.g. //@author A0909865T-unused 
Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.
The //@author tag should be used to mark *all* code you claim credit for.
INCLUDE: comments, test code.
Code you reused from elsewhere: Mark such code as //@author matric-number-reused e.g. //@author A0909865T-reused where the matric number belongs to the person responsible for reusing that code.
EXCLUDE code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also mark such code //@author generated e.g. //@author generated
